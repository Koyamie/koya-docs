Hooks such as \[\] or &lt;&gt; should not be used when executing commands.
{% endhint %}

**Usage:** Each command has one or multiple usages, usages are explaining how the commands can be used and the possible subcommands existing.

**Aliases:** Each command can own one or multiple aliases, aliases means the command can work either with the original name, either with one of the aliases. _Example:_ `^^lovecalc` command also works by using `^^lc`.

**Cooldowns:** Each command has a pre-defined cooldown, this cooldown can't be changed and is working per-user. When executing a command you are under global cooldown for this command.
